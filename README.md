# TOP EFT combination repository
This repository contains several scripts and tools that are needed to run the combination of several TOP EFT analysis. The combination includes both direct searches for new physics (such as TOP-22-006), and indirect searches that are obtained from the reinterpretation of unfolded observables in differential measurements. 

Below, an index to the different sources of documentation can be found.
